MapleBinomials (a Maple Package for Binomial Ideals)
Authors: Alexandru Iosif and Hamid Rahkooy



Main Functions:

1) monomialCoefficient
This procedure takes a polynomial f and it returns the coefficient of the monomial m in with respect to the variables variables.

2) coefficientsMatrix
This procedure takes a list of polynomials and outputs the matrix C of coefficients of the polynomial list.

3) isBinomial
This procedure checks binomiality of an ideal (here binomial means no monomials are in the ideal).

4) isBinomialGroebner
This procedure tests binomiality using a Groebner Basis.
